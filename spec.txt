Game of Life spec:
two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead,

1. Make a matrix.
2. Provide the initial pattern.
3. Apply the rules up on it. 

Rules:

	0. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
	1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
	2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
	3. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

4. print the new pattern.
5. Go to 3
